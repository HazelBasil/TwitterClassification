# TwitterGatekeeping
Python code that cleans, collects, and prepares Twitter user data for Dr. Hazel Kwon's Audience Gatekeeping research project. 
The code is built upon the Twython package. 

In addition to the Twitter methods, using Scikit-learn there will be some Machine Learning methods.  Speicfically the 
bag-of-words algorithim. 

A list of files and their functionalities:

1. getTwitterUserDescriptions.py : collect information on up to 300 Twitter User Descriptions outputed to a .csv file.
2. getUserInformation.py: collect more data than just descriptions and timezone information (which is the functionality of                             getTwitterUserDescriptions.py). 
                          (Goal is to attach a user interface that allows users to collect Twitter data without any code)
